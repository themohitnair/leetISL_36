This repository contains solutions to LeetCode problems based on different data structures. Each problem statement is accompanied by a C++ code implementation, which has been tested and accepted by LeetCode.

## Problem Summaries

### Problem 1: Shuffle the Array

Given an array `nums` consisting of 2n elements in the form `[x1,x2,...,xn,y1,y2,...,yn]`, return the array in the form `[x1,y1,x2,y2,...,xn,yn]`.

### Problem 2 (i): Shuffle String

Given a string `s` and an integer array `indices` of the same length, shuffle the string such that the character at the ith position moves to `indices[i]` in the shuffled string.

### Problem 2 (ii): Strictly Palindromic Number

Determine if an integer `n` is strictly palindromic, i.e., for every base `b` between 2 and `n - 2`, the string representation of `n` in base `b` is palindromic.

### Problem 3: Min Stack

Design a stack that supports push, pop, top, and retrieving the minimum element in constant time.

### Problem 4: Design Front Middle Back Queue

Design a queue that supports push and pop operations in the front, middle, and back.

### Problem 5: Rotate List

Given the head of a linked list, rotate the list to the right by k places.
